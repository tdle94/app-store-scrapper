# detox is unmaintained and incompatible with tox > 3.6

`detox` was a plugin for [`tox`](https://pypi.org/project/tox/) to enable parallel environment execution. `tox` 3.7 added a native possibility to do this (`tox -p|--parallel`) and effectively supercedes detox.

# What is detox?

detox is the distributed version of [tox](https://pypi.org/project/tox/).  It makes efficient use of multiple CPUs by running all possible activities in parallel.  It has the same options and configuration that tox has so after installation can just run:

    detox

in the same way and with the same options with which you would run `tox`, see the [tox home page](http://tox.readthedocs.io) for more info.

Additionally, detox offers a `-n` or `--num` option to set the number of concurrent processes to use.

**NOTE** due to the concurrent execution of the testenvs the output of the different testruns is not printed to the terminal. Instead they are logged into separate files inside the `log` directories of the testenvs.


# CHANGELOG

## 0.19

- as tox added a parallel mode in 3.7 detox will only work with older versions of tox now so the installation requires a version of tox < 3.7
- mark repository as unmaintained
- add a warning at the end of the testrun hinting the user to try it without detox and a version of tox > 3.6

## 0.18

Note that usedevelop still does not seem to be fixed (PRs welcome)

- integrate usable fixes from stale PR7
    - (fix [#20](https://github.com/tox-dev/detox/issues/20) detox
      ignores/breaks usedevelop - by Kendall Chuang
    - (fix [#21](https://github.com/tox-dev/detox/issues/21)
      detox doesn't support skipsdist config option - by Kendall Chuang
- convert changelog to markdown and render as part of description on PyPI
- detox version now prints own version and then what tox has to say
  (it's a plugin after all and that should be made clear)
- [Internal changes]
    - add extra dependencies in setup.py
    - update tests to current pytest API
    - use black for code formatting
    - use flake8 for linting
    - add descriptions to tox envs
    - add a "dev" tox env

## 0.17 (botched release)

## 0.14.post2

    `README.md`

## 0.14.post1

- propagate information about new location of issie tracker to PyPI

## 0.14.0

- (fix [#15](https://github.com/tox-dev/detox/issues/15)) make detox
    aware of new way to fetch a package in tox 3.3 - by Oliver
    Bestwalter
- (fix [#15](https://github.com/tox-dev/detox/issues/15)) make detox
    aware of new way to fetch a package in tox 3.3 - by Oliver
    Bestwalter
- (fix [#25](https://github.com/tox-dev/detox/issues/25)) print out
    detox version rather than tox version including detox version as
    plugin, when invoking [detox --version]{.title-ref} - by Oliver
    Bestwalter

## 0.13.0

- (fix [#283](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/283)) detox
    creates virtualenvs repeatedly and unnecessarily - by Thomas Steinke

## 0.12.0

- (fix [#792](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/792)) bump tox
    version constraint to <4.0 - by Pi Delport
- support and test with Python 2.7, 3.4+ - by Miro Hrončok
- fix project url to point ot github - by Neil Halelamien
- remove some unused imports - by Nir Soffer

## 0.11.0

- #406: Add support for running detox as python -m detox Thanks André
    Caron (@AndreLouisCaron).
- (infrastructure) add Travis CI setup. Thanks Timothée Mazzucotelli
    (@Pawamoy).
- add "-n NUMPROC" option to set number of processes. The default is
    the number of CPUs as determined by multiprocessing.cpu_count() or
    "2" if the call does not work (e.g. on py27/windows). Thanks
    Timothée Mazzucotelli (@Pawamoy).

## 0.10.0


- get compatible again to tox-2.0

## 0.9.4

- get compatible again to eventlet by avoiding to import
    eventlet.processes, thanks Takeshi Komiya for the PR.
- make detox honor skipsdist. Thanks Timoth Messier for the PR.
- change license to MIT

## 0.9.3

- fix issue6: quickly make detox work with tox-1.6 again (although not
    all 1.6 features supported, e.g. --develop does not work)
- fix issue3: don't claim a TROVE identifier of "python3" because
    detox itself depends on eventlet which does not work on py3 yet.
    (Nevertheless detox will create py3 environments through tox of
    course)
- fix issue1: support python2.5 again (although we might drop it in
    the future -- it's enough of tox/detox can _[create]() and handle
    py25 environments, they don't neccessarily need to support running
    themselv on py25)

## 0.9.2

- fix issue4 - fail properly if sdist-packaging fails

## 0.9.1

- fix issue5 - small adjustments to work with latest tox-1.4.3 version

## 0.9

- initial release
